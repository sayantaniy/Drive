# GDrive-like File Storage App (Incomplete)

**Status:** In Progress  
This is a simple Google-Drive–like project I’m building to learn backend development. The project is incomplete — authentication is finished, but the file upload/storage part is not implemented yet.

I followed a YouTube tutorial for guidance and added my own understanding while building it.
